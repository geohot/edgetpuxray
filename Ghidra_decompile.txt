I spent some time looking at the decompiled edgetpu_compiler.
I saw a few refenreces to llvm in there, specificaly to llvm::mlir, so i went looking on the web for that library.
Found it here https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/mlir/lib
It seams like the people who built the edgetpu compiler used the mlir lib.
I started comparing strings in the source and from that I managed to identify some of the functions.
With the class definitions from the llvm project and some correctly placed breakpoints,
one should be able to figurue out what ops are defined and more.

The most interesting function that i managed to identify that i think would benefit from some breakpoints is(located at 0x00839dc0 in Ghidra):
RegisteredOperationName::insert(
    StringRef name, Dialect &dialect, TypeID typeID,
    ParseAssemblyFn &&parseAssembly, PrintAssemblyFn &&printAssembly,
    VerifyInvariantsFn &&verifyInvariants,
    VerifyRegionInvariantsFn &&verifyRegionInvariants, FoldHookFn &&foldHook,
    GetCanonicalizationPatternsFn &&getCanonicalizationPatterns,
    detail::InterfaceMap &&interfaceMap, HasTraitFn &&hasTrait,
    ArrayRef<StringRef> attrNames,
    PopulateDefaultAttrsFn &&populateDefaultAttrs)
  
  
Since most functions seam to come more or less in the order that they where writen in the .cpp files
it should be quite easy to identify the functions that are inbetwen the already indentified functions.
